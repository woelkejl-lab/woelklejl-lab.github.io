      Game Winner </h3>
    <p>The game to get the Browns to the championship was a hard fought one. the final play to get through without overtime was all put on the new sixth grade kicker from twenty yards. As he had lined up for the kick and sent it but as the ball was flying older kids had hit it to the left. As the people thought it was over it hit the post and went in!</p>
